# Kotlin – Assignment 2: filter, map, reduce

This is a simple Kotlin console program that practices functions and
higher-order functions (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`).

## What the program does

1. Creates a list of integers from 1 to 100.
2. Uses `filter` to get all even numbers.
3. Uses `map` to get the square of each number.
4. Uses `reduce` to calculate the sum of all numbers.
5. Prints the results with clear labels:

- `Evens:`
- `Squares:`
- `Sum:`
